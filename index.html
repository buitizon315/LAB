            <p>Hi, I’m Carla Eunice Buitizon, 19 years of age, and currently studying at Sorsogon College of Criminology Inc. This website I made is about Cybersecurity and Plagiarism. Both of them are important issues in today's digital age, as they can impact individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. As you dive through this website, I hope that you can learn more about the topics and broaden your knowledge on understanding more about Cybersecurity and Plagiarism.</p>

        <p>In today’s digital age, the integrity of information and the security of data are paramount. This guide sheds light on two critical aspects: Plagiarism and Cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>Plagiarism undermines academic and professional work by appropriating others' ideas without acknowledgment. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, involves protecting systems and data from digital attacks. Both issues have significant implications in education, business, and personal contexts.</p>
        <p>Through this guide, I aim to provide insights and practical advice to address these challenges.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else’s work, ideas, or intellectual property without proper attribution, presenting it as your own. This includes copying text directly, paraphrasing without proper citation, or using someone else's research without acknowledgment. It's a serious academic offense that can lead to severe consequences, including failing a course, suspension, or even expulsion. To avoid plagiarism, always cite your sources correctly, paraphrase ideas in your own words, and give credit to the original author. Remember, academic integrity is essential, and plagiarism undermines the value of your work and the learning process.</p>
